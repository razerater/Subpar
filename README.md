##SÜBPAR
#pronounced "soob-par"
This is a class project by Raz Reed (me) and David Toomey. We created a website for a fictitious business called Sübpar, a cheap version of Uber where the cars are old and beat up and the drivers are ex-convicts. The website is designed to be run locally using Sinatra - just download and unzip it, type "ruby main.rb" in the terminal, go to localhost:4567 in your browser, and it's there.
